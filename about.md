I am a PhD student in machine learning at the University of Cambridge, working on AI safety with David Krueger. I think it's plausible that we'll build AI systems capable of doing *everything humans can do in front of computers* in the next decade or two, and am hoping to ensure that the (inevitably widespread) deployment of such systems won't lead the humanity to permanently lose control over our future.

<!-- and am hoping to ensure that the long-term impact of such systems' inevitably widespread deployment is positive. -->

<!-- I’m hoping to ensure that powerful AI systems of the future do what we want them to do, with the aim of increasing the likelihood of AI having a positive long-term impact on humanity. -->
 
<!-- Previously, I did a masters in AI at the University of Amsterdam, and had the pleasure to work with UC Berkeley’s <a href="https://humancompatible.ai/">Center for Human-Compatible AI</a> during and after the masters. In addition, I worked on deep RL and robotics at Sony AI Zurich for a bit over a year. -->

I earned my master's degree in AI from the University of Amsterdam, and had the opportunity to work with UC Berkeley's <a href="https://humancompatible.ai/">Center for Human-Compatible AI</a> during and after my studies. I also spent a year working on deep RL and robotics at Sony AI Zurich.

Next, I'll be starting a PhD at the University of Cambridge, where I'll work on technical AGI safety with David Krueger. -->


<!---Last fall I graduated cum laude with a MSc in AI from the University of Amsterdam, which I was able to attend thanks to a $63k grant from the Open Philanthropy Project. During and after the masters I had the pleasure to work with UC Berkeley's Center for Human-Compatible AI; this collaboration resulted in two papers. Next, I am joining Sony AI in Zurich starting September 2020.->


<!---I am a second year MSc artificial intelligence student at the University of Amsterdam. These days I am focused on figuring out how an AI can robustly infer what humans want from what they do. --->
